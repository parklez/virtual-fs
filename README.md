# virtual-fs
A terminal that works more or less like in UNIX for exploring directory trees

### Issues
C wipes local variables once functions return something, in the future I'd like to get rid of global variables...

### Download
- On Linux `gcc terminalfs.c -o out`.
- There's a compiled windows version available at the [releases page](https://github.com/parklez/virtual-fs/releases).
